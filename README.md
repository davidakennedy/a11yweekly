# Accessibility Weekly

A weekly dose of web accessibility to help you bring it into your every day work. This is the website for the newsletter of the same name.

Why?

I started this newsletter because I believe web workers should think about, talk about and practice accessibility differently. Anyone can make the Web more accessible one change at a time. That only happens if we share our knowledge, and this is one way I'm sharing mine.
