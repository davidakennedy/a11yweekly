Rachel Andrew provides a warning about [grid, content re-ordering and accessibility](https://rachelandrew.co.uk/archives/2019/06/04/grid-content-re-ordering-and-accessibility/). Just like anything else, you need to be mindful of how something works, and why when you change it. Andrew also suggests that maybe it's time for a way to allow the tab and reading order to follow the visual order.
