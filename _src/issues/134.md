## New to A11y

Billy Gregory has a talk about a concept called [Some Users’ Experience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHeuPUNLp30), or #SUX. That's what happens when the user experience fails to consider all users. It's a great talk and a catchy way to think about how to involve more users in the experiences of what we design.

## Correction

In last week's issue, I included a link to [part three](https://developer.paciellogroup.com/blog/2019/04/think-like-an-accessible-ux-researcher-part-3/) of David Sloan's "Think like an accessible UX researcher" series, but misidentified it as a press release. It's a blog post, and I've included it again this week with the correction.
