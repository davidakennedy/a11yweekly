Jessica Ivins has a list of her favorite spots on the web to [learn about inclusive design and accessibility](https://medium.com/@jessicaivins/my-favorite-resources-for-learning-inclusive-design-and-accessibility-b8f24d5a90df?source=friends_link&sk=626e600ce8293e2ecc94daf8a65015a9) that you should check out. Yes, it includes this newsletter, but the best part was a few sites and posts I hadn't read before. It's a nice, short list that packs a lot of knowledge.
