Kat Holmes shares her thoughts on [inclusive design](https://www.fastcodesign.com/90166413/what-youre-getting-wrong-about-inclusive-design) with Co.Design, and how there are many intersections between design and how it can benefit many people. She says, "Inclusive design is a process, not a result." I've seen similar thoughts referenced a few times in the past month or so, so it's worth committing to memory.
