Lindsey Kopacz wrote a [guide to accessible interactive components using React libraries](https://www.a11ywithlindsey.com/blog/accessible-interactive-components-react). In it, you'll find two important messages: "First, Front End JavaScript Frameworks render HTML. Second, JavaScript frameworks don’t produce inaccessible HTML. Web developers produce inaccessible HTML." So true, and this guide helps you avoid that second important message.
