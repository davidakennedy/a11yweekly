## New to A11y

Many of us have started to attend more virtual meetings these days. Two recent posts surfaced to help you make them more inclusive: [Ten things to improve conference call accessibility](https://medium.com/@sheribyrnehaber/ten-things-to-improve-conference-call-accessibility-4af6db5c8104) and [How to make your next virtual meeting more accessible](https://www.deque.com/blog/virtual-meeting-accessible-zoom/). The first post focuses on more general actions you can take while the second centers on the Zoom platform. Each provides helpful advice.
