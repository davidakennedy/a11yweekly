Carie Fisher reminds you that the topic of accessible images is much more nuanced than you   think. The article on [accessible images](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/05/accessible-images/) reviews the different types of images, dives into some real-world examples of inaccessible public service announcements (PSAs), and discusses which elements matter most when critical messages need to reach everyone. I'm sure I'll refer to this post constantly, and you should bookmark it too.
