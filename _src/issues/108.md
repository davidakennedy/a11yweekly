Ashley Walls writes about [bringing inclusive practices to product design](https://medium.com/microsoft-design/bringing-inclusive-practices-to-product-design-e8bd37dd1682). She lays out why it isn't a fad. I like how it goes into how everyone approaches things differently, and that impacts your approach as a designer.
