Alastair Somerville points to how [accessibility is where you start](https://acuity-design.medium.com/accessibility-is-where-you-start-d3b0feaff474) because it's the only way of avoiding huge mistakes and huge costs. I love the point made around how accessibility helps you anticipate adaptions and alternative paths in designs.
