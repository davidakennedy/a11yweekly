David Kennedy (hey, that's who makes this newsletter!) discusses the [intersection of markup, content and context in accessibility](https://www.24a11y.com/2019/the-intersection-of-markup-content-and-context-in-accessibility/). In this post, I humbly try to help you level up by showing you how HTML, or markup, needs to change based on the content of a site or application, and the different abilities of those using it.
