## New to A11y

We, the web works who make the web every day, make accessibility harder than it has to be. I agree with Pablo Stanley that [designing for accessibility is not that hard](https://uxdesign.cc/designing-for-accessibility-is-not-that-hard-c04cc4779d94). My favorite advice? "Make accessibility part of your design research." Because accessibility is design.
