Carie Fisher shows you how to approach [accessible SVGs](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/03/accessible-svgs-inclusiveness-beyond-patterns/) when thinking about color, motion and more. You've no doubt used SVGs in your projects before. Maybe you haven't thought of these angles, but don't worry because Carie, as always, gives plenty of code examples and detail to help you learn.
