Manuel Matuzovic reminds you that [bad accessibility equals bad quality](https://www.matuzo.at/blog/bad-accessibility-equals-bad-quality/). That may help you or the people around you think about your task of creating inclusive experiences differently. Good accessibility means your experiences work better for people and your code is cleaner. Who doesn't want that?
